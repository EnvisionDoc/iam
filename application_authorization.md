It is to authorize the applications to access assets data which are created or purchased of the organization.

## Authorize Application

2. Click |img| of the application that you want to grant permission.

3. In the **Asset Authorization** page.

- The asset tree on the left includes the root node and all child nodes. Tick the check box before a child node, and all sites subordinate to the node will be selected.

- The right side shows the information of all sites under the currently selected node and the path of the site location.

## Note

Once the “All Assets” option is checked, any new site accessed will be authorized for the current application by default.

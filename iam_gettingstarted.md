## Step 1: Create an user account

1. Click **IAM > Users** from the left navigation tree.
2. Click **Create User** under the **Internal User** tab.
3. Finish the basic information settings and click **Next**. The basic information includes username, password, moblie phone number, email address and the way to send the account information to users. For more information, see [Managing users](managing_users).

## Step 2: Grant authorization policies

1. Click **Authorize** from the **Operation** column for a user account that you created in step 1.

2. Edit the authorization of user accounts by changing the granted policies or adding the user to specific user groups.

If there are no authorization policies or user groups for selection yet, create the policies and user groups first. For more information, see [Managing policies](managing_policies) and [Managing user groups](managing_groups).

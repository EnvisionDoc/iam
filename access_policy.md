# Policy, Role, and Access

A policy is a collection of permissions to the resources in EnOS (such as services, functions, and data). Policy takes effect only when assigned to a user or user group. You can design policies for different roles according to the user and user group definition based on the granularity that EnOS supports:

- EnOS service and tool: support menu level authorization.
- Assets data: support access to all assets data.

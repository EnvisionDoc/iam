# Enabling Multi-factor Authentication

 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a layer of protection on top of the password to increase the security of the EnOS cloud. Users need to provide extra factors when they access to EnOS.

 With MFA enabled, when the user attempts to log in to EnOS Console, they need to provide the following factors of credentials:

- Factor 1: the user credential (username and password)
- Factor 2: a verification code received on the registered email or mobile phone.

This article instructs how to enable and disable Multi-Factor authentication. 


1. In the EnOS Console, click **IAM > Organization** from the left navigation panel.

2. In the **Organization Profile** page, click **Edit**.

3. At the bottom of the page, in the **Security Settings** section, you can enable or disable Multi-Factor Authentication by toggling the switch button.

4. Click **Save** at the right corner to save the changes.
